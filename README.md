This project is a snippet of work from my thesis and innovation at volvo.

The idea is to predict the state of the vehicle at time 't' where the model is trained on couple of other vehicles driving patterns and learnt the behaviour of the states.

I used LSTM network, as the data is time series and it has given me a pretty good accuracy of 83%
